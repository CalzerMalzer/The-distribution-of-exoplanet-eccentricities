# The-distribution-of-exoplanet-eccentricities

Over the past twenty years, there has been a significant increase in the discovery of exoplanets, with more than 3000 confirmed planets to date. The considerable size of this sample, along with a well-understood sampling function, allows for the computation of multi-dimensional distributions of planet characteristics with a reasonable level of certainty. These distributions could offer valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying planet formation and evolution.

In this study, the main focus was to examine the distribution of orbital eccentricity within various ranges of orbital period. To keep the analysis straightforward, the potential selection effects were disregarded. Additionally, the assumption that the beta distribution serves as a suitable model for describing the eccentricity distribution within each period range is made.

The objective was to employ the Maximum Likelihood method to estimate the parameters (α, β) of the beta distribution based on a provided list of eccentricities. Furthermore, the aim was to calculate a 90% confidence region to assess the uncertainty associated with the parameter estimates.
